# First-Timer
First Timer is a simple program built in HTML/CSS/JS that displays a Welcome screen on a user's First Time. After the first visit, the welcome screen will no-longer show, unless the user resets the cookie via JS command line, resets their cookies via browser settings, or manually selecting the view button.
